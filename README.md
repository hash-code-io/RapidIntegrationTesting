# Simple, opinionated integration testing libraries

This library is focused on providing a simplified and streamlined experience for Asp.Net Core's Integration testing.
It builds on [testcontainers-dotnet](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-dotnet)

# Opinionated

This library is very opinionated, which is going to limit who it'll be interesting for. Our main motivation is to provide easily
reusable libraries that we use internally to develop our projects, so we naturally take dependencies on quite a lot of libraries and require their
usage. If you agree with our library usage feel free to use our libraries - otherwise we hope to provide some inspiration for your own implementations.
